The Unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united* States of America

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the Political Bands which have
connected them with another and to assume among the Powers of the Earth the separate and equal Station to which the
Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel them to the Separation

We hold these Truths to be self-evident that all Men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness -- That to secure these
Rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed that
whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive to these Ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish
it and to institute new Government laying its Foundation on such Principles and organizing its Powers in such Form
as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments
long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shown that
Mankind are more disposed to suffer while Evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to
which they are accustomed But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations pursuing invariably the same Object
evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their Right it is their Duty to throw off such
Government and to provide new Guards for their future Security Such has been the patient Sufferance of these Colonies;
and such is now the Necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government The History of the
present King of Great- Britain is a History of repeated Injuries and Usurpations all having in direct Object the
Establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States To prove this let Facts be submitted to a candid World
