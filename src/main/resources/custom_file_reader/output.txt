I'm sure you've been asked many times whether you're an introvert or an extrovert For some people it's an easy choice but for most of us it's difficult to choose one way or the other

It's hard to choose because the introvert/extrovert dichotomy reflects a tired and outdated view of personality Personality traits exist along a continuum and the vast majority of us aren't introverts or extroverts - we fall somewhere in the middle

Personality consists of a stable set of preferences and tendencies through which we approach the world Personality traits form at an early age and are fixed by early adulthood Many important things about you change over the course of your lifetime but your personality isn't one of them
