You think I'm delirious with malaria?

This happened.
In Odessa, this happened.

"I'll come at four," promised Maria.

Eight...
Nine...
Ten.

Soon after,
The evening,
Frowning,
And Decemberish,

Left the windows
And vanished in dire darkness.

Behind me, I hear the neighing and laughter
Of candelabras.

You wouldn't recognize me if you knew me prior:
A bulk of sinews
Moaning,
Fidgeting.
What can such a clod desire?
But a clod desires many things.
