Course project SEA BATTLE

---------------------------------------

Here you can try to play Sea Battle game!


I developed a version of a game "Player vs Computer"

Just to make a game a bit faster - all ships automatically are created randomly before starting this game.
And you might not spend time for creating it by yourself.

There are:
 4-deck ships - 1
 3-deck ships - 2
 2-deck ships - 3
 1-deck ships - 4

 (Just because I ve remembered these rules since my childhood:))

 After starting a game you see your seaMap (with blue color) and you should make your first move!

 If your/computer's ship is found, cell will have a yellow color.
 If a ship is destroyed fully, a color is red.
 If you/computer makes a mistake - you wil see just a white "star".

 I decided to make a console interface of game in Russian as our traditional game:)

 Hope this game will be convenient for you!
