GENERAL
2 gameController modes are available: Player vs Player and Player vs Computer (very easy).
Each player has 10 ships: 1*4deck, 2*3, 3*2, 4*1.

SHIP PLACEMENT
You can choose how to place ships: manually or automatically.
It's not allowed to place ships close to each other (diagonal cells count as well).
You put a ship by pointing its topLeft point and with position ("v" - vertical, "h" - horizontal).
    So your input should be like this: [A7 V] or [b1 h].

RULES
Shot format: [A7] or [b1].
You cannot shoot out of board or cells that you have shot before.
When you destroy a ship all cells around are filled automatically and you cannot shoot them anymore (cause there are no ships).
Each player has same count of moves.
Game over when one of player (or both) don't have "alive" ships.
