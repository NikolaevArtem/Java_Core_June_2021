| Number | Solution  | Short description
| --- | --- | --- |
| HW1 | [Console printer](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/tree/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_1) | The app that reads input arguments and prints them, until "error" argument |
| HW2.1 | [Traffic Light](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/blob/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_2/TrafficLight.java) | This console app reads time like the number of seconds and prints what colour of the traffic light will be on at the selected second.|
| HW2.2 | [Pyramid Printer](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/blob/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_2/PyramidPrinter.java) | This console app reads integer and prints a pyramid from 'x' characters, where the top is one character and bottom consists of a number of characters equals read integer. |
| HW2.3 | [Random Chars Table](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/blob/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_2/RandomCharsTable.java) | This console app reads two integers and one word (even or odd) that determines a strategy. Then it generates a random table with characters from A to Z and shows it. Depending on the chosen strategy at the end of the output it prints even or odd letters from the table, where A = 65, B = 66 and so on according to ASCII Table.  |
| HW2.Tests | [Tests](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/tree/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/test/java/homework_2) | Tests for homework_2 |
| HW3 | [ImmutableClass](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/blob/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_3/ImmutableClass.java) | Custom immutable class. Made only for learning.|
| HW4.1 | [CustomFileReader](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/tree/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_4/custom_file_reader) | Class for reading files and printing text to console without dots and commas. Implemented six ways. |
| HW4.2 | [CustomAnnotation](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/tree/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_4/custom_annotation) | Implemented two annotations: for filling class constructor and for printing field names and their value. |
| HW4.3 | [Singleton](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/tree/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_4/singleton) | Simple singleton |
| HW4.Tests | [Tests](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/tree/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/test/java/homework_4) | Tests for homework_4 |
| HW5 | [Recursion](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/tree/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_5/recursion) | Recursive way to calculate a power of a number. |
| HW5.Tests | [Tests](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/tree/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/test/java/homework_5/) | Tests for homework_5 |
