| Number | Solution  | Short description
| --- | --- | --- |
| HW1 | [Console printer](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/tree/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_1) | The app that reads input arguments and prints them, until "error" argument |
| HW2.1 | [Traffic Light](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/blob/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_2/TrafficLight.java) | This console app reads time like the number of seconds and prints what colour of the traffic light will be on at the selected second.|
| HW2.2 | [Pyramid Printer](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/blob/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_2/PyramidPrinter.java) | This console app reads integer and prints a pyramid from 'x' characters, where the top is one character and bottom consists of a number of characters equals read integer. |
| HW2.3 | [Random Chars Table](https://github.com/NikolaevArtem/Java_Core_June_2021/blob/feature/DmitriySlavinskiy/src/main/java/homework_2/RandomCharsTable.java) | This console app reads two integers and one word (even or odd) that determines a strategy. Then it generates a random table with characters from A to Z and shows it. Depending on the chosen strategy at the end of the output it prints even or odd letters from the table, where A = 65, B = 66 and so on according to ASCII Table.  |
